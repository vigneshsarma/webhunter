#WebHunter
##A personal web search engine.

This builds on the basic code for search engine, indexing and ranking from Udacity Class CS 101.On top of that I have added a web interface,using flask framework.The basic code form udacity is found at *wsgi/hunter/search.py*.

##Added Features:
* A web interface have been added using flask web-framework and jinja2 templating engine.

##Planed changes:
* Use SGML parser to provide a better and more accurate HTML parsing.
* Use Mango DB to provide a persistent index and rank storage.
* Use urllib to get real web-pages and index those.
